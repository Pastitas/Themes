#Clic
![Clic](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Clic/clic.png)

For mouseplebs. Work in progress, only a rough outline, it's only for fun and doesn't really work. For example, mouse click stop working when changing workspaces using the panel arrows.

* Bar-ain't-recursive (wip branch) to allow for clickable elements in the panel.
* xtitle to output the client name. An [X] icon to close it.
* Clicking on MENU launch myGTKmenu.
* Replaced tags in the panel by arrows (with the tag number). Click on them to switch to the next tag.

I plan to:
* Implement notifications, through dzen-notify, statnot or not-stat.
* Clicking on the hour shows the date in a popup.
* Find a way to notice me which tags are occupied. I might use dzen to do that, with a fading message in the center of the screen when switching tags. Just like any shitty DE.
