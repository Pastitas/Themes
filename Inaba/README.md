#Inaba

I use [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm), with lemonboy's [bar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar).

Music player is ncmpcpp, terminal is urxvt, shell is zsh with a syntax highlighting plugin and the file manager is SpaceFM.

##Config files
*bspwmrc* goes into `~/.config/bspwm`

*bspwmpanel* and *bspwmpanel-bar* generate the content of the panel. Put them in your $PATH.

I also included the `config.h` I use for lemonboy's bar.

##Mails
On my system, cron fetches mails every hours. Configure it to call `mailbox_to_fifo` after that.

    0 * * * * /usr/bin/getmail --rcfile mailbox1 --rcfile mailbox2 ; /home/tatou/.bin/mailbox_to_fifo

I also made an alias in .zshrc so that when closing mutt it refreshes the number of unread mails.

    alias mutt='mutt ; mailbox_to_fifo'

##Notifications
The music notification on the left of the panel is generated by *not-stat*, a shitty shell script I wrote and use as a general purpose notification system. [Mpdcron](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1354247) calls `not-stat -m` each time the song changes.

I also configured sxhkd to call it after pressing various keybinds. Here's an example:

    XF86AudioRaiseVolume
     amixer set PCM 1dB+ ; not-stat -v

With those settings, pressing the XF86AudioRaiseVolume button will increase the PCM channel volume by 1 dB and then output the new volume value in place of the current song. The volume change notification will then disappear after 3 seconds (and get replaced by the current mpd song again).

##Font
In the terminal and the panel, I'm using a modified MonteCarlo font with manually added icon glyphs. You can find it in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/tree/master/.fonts/MonteCarlo-glyphes) repo.

The gtk font is Lucida Grande.

##Gtk theme and icons
The gtk theme is [there](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/tree/master/.themes/Custom). The gtk2 part is modified from SimpliX, the gtk3 part from Numix. It needs some fixing though, especially the gtk3 part (obviously). Also, I intended to redo it from scratch using only Numix as a base.

The icons are from [cldx/Numix](https://github.com/cldx/numix). They are incomplete and none of the mime type icons work properly in SpaceFM. As the repo seems abandoned, I might fix that someday.

##Misc
I use compton for shadows and fading.
