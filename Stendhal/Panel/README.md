#How to use?
![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/pixeldots.gif)

You will need [bar-aint-recursive](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar) (for the panel) and [dzen](https://github.com/robm/dzen) (for the popups).

LemonBoy recently (june, 12th 2014) added support for other buttons than the left click. The way he did it was frustrating, so [I did it another way](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/bar) (read the commit [message](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/bar/commit/81861bcddcdb8ed30165d1913d2093fba6120b80)). The way I did it is bad, but less useless. I will use my fork until he does it properly.

I also added a patch made by [this guy](https://github.com/pentla/bar), that allows to print the current x coordinate of the clickable area.

**My files won't work if you are using the vanilla bar.**

To have the same panel as me, put all the scripts in your $PATH. Sometimes, it might need another script I put in `~/.bin`, so look for it in the appropriate [place](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/tree/master/.bin).

The developper was lazy and haven't implemented a way to increase the maximum number of clickable areas without recompiling. In the source code, there is a `#define N 20` somewhere, **increase** that value if you need more (if you use everything I did, you will). If you use my fork, that value is already increased.


#Panel
- To start everything, just launch `panel`, it will create the panel fifo and start bar.
- `panel-skeleton` interprets where to put each information that is piped to the fifo.
- `panel-settings` contains various settings, like the colors. It is loaded by the other scripts.

All the special characters (icons...) are custom made. You will need the *MonteCarloPanel* and *MonteCarloMedium* fonts from my Mon√©gasque repo, or add the characters yourself to your font of choice.

If you want to use your own font with your own glyphs, just know that I had some issues with vertical alignment. I fixed it by duplicating my font and changing some of its properties (namely *SIZE*, *PIXEL_SIZE* and *FONT_DESCENT*) to align it properly. That's why I have both a *MonteCarloMedium* font and a *MonteCarloPanel* font, the later being dedicated to the panel.

#Workspaces
![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/workspaces.gif)
The startmenu is made by mygtkmenu. It appears when clicking on the blank space on the left of the workspace list, but you can easily add an icon or more space by editing the appropriate line in `panel-settings`.

The snippet that draws the appropriate icon according to the state of the workspace was made by Baskerville and is in panel-skeleton.

#Music and system events
![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/notstat.gif)

The music notification on the left of the panel is generated by *not-stat*, a shell script inspired by [statnot](https://github.com/halhen/statnot).

It will display a notification in the panel and show the music again if there is no new notifications during three seconds.

You call it like this:

    pkill not-stat ; not-stat -<x>

**Do not forget** to kill the *not-stat* process before calling it, else the three seconds wait will not work properly.

##Simple music controls
![Label](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/label-leftclick.gif)

- A **left** click on the label will toggle *play/pause* through mpc.
- A **right** click will *open* ncmpcpp.

The blue icon can toggle other things, read the *Clickable menu and popups* section. 

*Note: this makes use of both left and right clicking, so it's* **not** *usable with vanilla bar! Refer to the first section.*

##Calling not-stat
###With mpdcron
On each song change or mpd event (like play/pause), [mpdcron](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1354247) will execute the following:

    pkill not-stat ; not-stat -m &


###With sxhkd
It's also bound to keybinds, for example:

    XF86AudioRaiseVolume
        amixer set PCM 1dB+ ; pkill not-stat ; not-stat -v

With those lines in your sxhkdrc, pressing the *XF86AudioRaiseVolume* will raise the PCM channel volume by 1 decibel, display the new volume value and show the music status again after three seconds of inactivity.

Read my `sxhkdrc` if you want other examples. I use not-stat to tell me the remaining battery time for example.

###With buttons
The script is also called when clicking on various buttons or when using the different sliders. Read the next section.


#Clickable menu and popups
![Left click](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/icon-leftclick.gif)

For bar-aint-recursive itself,
- `panel-monitor` spawn settings for brightness, volume, keyboard layout, music... As shown in the gif above, they appear when you click on the blue icon.
- `panel-music_control` is a simplified panel-monitor, dedicated to music controls. Those appears when you *right* click on the blue icon.

For the popups and their sliders,
- `dzen-submenu-window`creates the dzen popup and the fifo used by the sliders.
- `dzen-submenu-content` creates the actual content of the popup, like the sliders.

**Do not forget to create `~/.panel/PID/dzen-submenu.pid`**, else a few things will not work (like moving the indicator through other means than clicking on the slider).

*Note: this makes use of both left and right clicking, so it's* **not** *usable with vanilla bar! Refer to the first section.*

####Sound controls
Should work out of the box. I just use the CLI tools that come with ALSA to get and change the volume of the Master and PCM channels.

####Brightness controls
To draw the slider, it reads the current screen brightness value in `/sys/<...>/backlight/<...>/brightness` and its max value in `/sys/<...>/backlight/<...>/max_brightness`.

The path to those files probably won't be the same on our respective systems, so edit this in the `panel-settings`.

The same for the script I use to change the backlight, you will need to adapt it to your system, so it changes the value of the right file.

####Music controls
A **right** click on the blue icon will spawn `panel-music_control`:
![Right click](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/icon-rightclick.gif)

`panel-monitor` and `panel-music_control` use a script from my ~/.bin called `mpc-script`. You might want to replace the occurence of `mpc-script prev` by `mpc prev` (or just grab the currently unfinished `mpc-script` from my `~/.bin`).

The dzen popup provides shortcuts to launch [mpdviz](https://github.com/neeee/mpdviz), *ncmpcpp* and my [coverart](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/coverart) script.

The coverart script is not that good, but who cares. Now that dunst is starting to support images I might stop using it anyway and write something else.

#Mails
`panel-mail` is called by cron after it fetches mails:

    0 * * * * /usr/bin/getmail --rcfile mailbox1 --rcfile mailbox2 ; /home/tatou/.bin/panel-mail

You should also make an alias so it's called when you close mutt:

    alias mutt='mutt ; panel-mail'

In the panel, you can **click** on the icon to hide the number of unread mails. A **right** click will open mutt.

#Calendar
Found it on Twily's [website](http://www.twily.info), tweaked it a little.

If you click on the date in the panel, the calendar will pop. If you click **again** on the date, it will disappear.

#To-watch list
![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/torrents.gif)
- `panel-torrents` displays the number of unwatched items in the panel. Clicking on that number spawns the popup, clicking again closes it.
- `dzen-to-watch` creates the popup. Right clicking closes the popup.
- `dzen-menu-content` creates the content of the popup from a text file acting as a list.
- [This](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/notify-torrent-done) script (called by transmission-daemon when a torrent is finished), will add the filename at the end of the text file.


I use rssdler to automatically download torrents from rss feeds and to send me a notification when a new .torrent file is about to be downloaded.
I know rssdler can be run as a daemon, but I use `cron` and `rssdler -r` instead.

In the popup, clicking on the [X] will delete the associated line from the text file and make the new (shortened) list be displayed instead.

Clicking on a file name will send it to `xdg-open`, so it should work with any file type. I chose to use xdg-open only out of lazyness, but it would be nice to have more control, especially for things like compressed files (personnally I want to use mcomix if it's a comic, but if it's not then opening it in a file manager would be a better solution).

The script assumes the file is inside your Torrents folder, if it's anywhere else it won't work.

For some reason, I cannot make it so that arrow keys can be used to navigate the list. If someone have a solution, I'm interested.

######To do
- Use something else than xdg-open.
- Make it work if the file is elsewhere than in the Torrents folder.
- Navigating with arrow keys.
- Clean the files.

#Mounted devices list
I haven't included it here. It's in my dotfiles repo though.

Appears when you do a right click on the date. It lists mounted devices and clicking on their name will open the file manager where they are mounted, while clicking on the [X] next to their name will unmount them.

It uses `udevil`.

#Todo list
It works exactly like the to watch list and the mounted devices list. I haven't included it either (yet). It uses `remind` to automatically add new tasks, or automatically remove the tasks that are out-of-date and cannot be done anymore.
