#Stendhal
![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/scrot.png)

I use [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) with [bar-aint-recursive](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar).

##Panel
Browse the [appropriate folder](http://github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/tree/master/Stendhal/Panel), it has .gif of it in action.

It's clickable, even if I don't click on it often (except for the torrent list and sometimes for the standalone music control or the keyboard layout switcher).

It clearly lacks ergonomy, as you currently need three to four clicks to change the volume or the brightness. I will try to improve that while keeping the same general idea if I can.

##Dock
It's [plank](https://launchpad.net/plank) with a [custom theme](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/share/plank/themes/Tatou/dock.theme) and [patched](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/Sources/plank-indicator.patch) to change the shape of the indicators.

The patch adds two new settings that need to be set in the `dock.theme`, `IndicatorHeight` and `IndicatorColor`.

##Notifications
It's [dunst](https://github.com/knopwob/dunst), that I patched ([here](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/Sources/dunst-centering_and_padding.patch) or [there](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dunst)) to have better (in my opinion) padding and to fix centering issues.

My dunstrc is [here](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/dunst/dunstrc).

##Icons
I only make new ones as I need them. Because of that, the theme is really incomplete.

I will upload it eventually, but maybe not on github as it's only binary files.

##Gtk theme
[201F](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/201F)

##Dmenu
I use dmenu2 and center it like this:

    dmenu_run -i -x 415 -y 330 -w 450 -h 20 -l 4 -fn 'Lucida Grande-8' -nb '#201F1D' -nf '#eddec9' -sb '#8F3724' -sf '#eddec9'

I use the same centering trick for every script I use involving dmenu.

If you think dmenu2 is bloat, you can always achieve the same exact look with vanilla dmenu, you will just need to patch it for custom width, x and y positioning and xft or pango.

##Compositor
I use the richardgv-dev branch of compton and apart from preventing tearing, I use it to make fade effects when opening/closing clients and to draw very light shadows on floating windows (not on tiled ones).

My config file is [there](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/compton.conf).
